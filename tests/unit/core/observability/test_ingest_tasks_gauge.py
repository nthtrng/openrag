"""S3-2 Phase 4 — the backlog gauge, sampled at scrape time.

``openrag_ingest_tasks`` is the one Tier-1 metric that is *read* rather than
counted. The authoritative number lives in the TaskStateManager actor, and a
gauge incremented on each transition would drift from it on every actor restart,
cancellation or fenced task.

Reading it during a scrape buys accuracy at the cost of a dependency, so what
these tests pin is the failure behaviour: a scrape must never fail, never block,
and never report a stale backlog as the current one.
