"""The bundled Grafana dashboards must work in any Grafana, not only the Compose one.

The same JSON is provisioned from disk by the Compose overlay and is meant to be
loaded by a platform's own Grafana on Kubernetes. Nothing in it may therefore
assume the Compose stack's names: a data source UID or a scrape job name that
only Compose defines leaves every panel blank anywhere else, with no error.

The query rules below carry the metric design into the dashboards: no unbounded
label, counters rated before they are aggregated, and no metric that nothing in
``openrag/`` declares, since an unknown name renders as an empty panel rather than
as an error.
