"""Worker-side metrics must actually arrive on Ray's metrics endpoint.

Every other test in this suite asserts that a *call* was made. None of them can
fail the way this task's metrics really fail. ``ray.util.metrics`` records
happily when Ray is not initialised — it is a no-op, not an error — so a metric
wired to the wrong backend, or recorded in a process nothing scrapes, raises
nothing anywhere. It simply never appears, and the first symptom is an empty
dashboard panel weeks later.

``openrag_circuit_breaker_state`` was exactly that: a ``prometheus_client``
Gauge set from inside Ray workers, where ``/metrics`` does not exist. It looked
instrumented, passed review, and could never have produced a sample for the
embedder or VLM breakers.

This test therefore starts a real (embedded) Ray, drives every worker-side
recorder from inside an actor, scrapes the node's metrics agent over HTTP, and
asserts the series are present in the exposition text. It is the only check here
that would have caught that defect.

Marked ``slow``: Ray's exporter flushes on an interval, so this costs seconds
rather than milliseconds.
