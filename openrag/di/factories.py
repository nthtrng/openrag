"""Generic cached component factory — bridges model config to registries.

Phase 11A. :func:`make_component_factory` is the one pattern the composition
root reuses for all four inference component kinds (embedder, reranker, LLM,
VLM). Given a model name it looks up the matching entry in a config section,
resolves which registered implementation to build, instantiates it through the
:class:`~core.utils.registry.Registry`, and caches the result so subsequent
calls reuse the same client (and its underlying httpx connection pool).

The factory returns a ``(factory_fn, cache)`` tuple. The cache dict is exposed
deliberately:

* **Shutdown.** The container appends every cache to a shared
  ``client_caches`` list and, on teardown, calls ``aclose()`` on each cached
  instance to release httpx connections.
* **Invalidation.** Post-refactoring, when a model endpoint is renamed or
  deleted at runtime, the owning service pops the stale entry
  (``cache.pop(old_name, None)``) so the next call rebuilds against the new
  config.

``config_section`` is typed against the :class:`ModelEndpointConfig` protocol
below — the unified per-endpoint config shape that lands with the DB-backed
model registry. Until that config exists the protocol documents the contract
the factory depends on; any object exposing those attributes (including a test
double) is accepted.
