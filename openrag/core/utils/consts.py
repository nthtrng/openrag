# it is the filesystem path served by ``GET /static/{extract_id}``, so letting a
# caller set it turns a metadata write into a cross-tenant file read (#713).

# ``content_sha256`` is the server-computed dedup hash: a caller-set value would
# corrupt dedup (spoofed ``DOCUMENT_CONTENT_EXISTS``), so it is protected here and
# re-set from the server side on the copy path after this strip runs.
# ``indexed_at`` controls reconciliation's grace period and repair eligibility,
# so only storage paths may assign it.
#
# ``partition`` is intentionally NOT here — the MCP update tool uses it as an
# authorized move control and re-checks editor access on the destination.
#
# Lives in core/ (not in one orchestrator) so every transport shares one guard:
# the upload path, the MCP tools, and the REST PATCH path previously each
# re-implemented this and the REST one simply omitted it.

# have it persisted in Milvus (the collection has a dynamic field), read back
# into ``Chunk.metadata``, and promoted to a top-level sibling of ``chunk`` —
# indistinguishable from the score this retrieval actually computed.
