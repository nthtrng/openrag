"""Inference metrics — the one Tier-1 set produced on both sides of Ray.

``ingest_*`` metrics only ever happen in a worker and ``http_*`` only ever in
the API process, so each has a single backend. Inference does not: the API
process embeds queries and calls the LLM and reranker, while the indexing
workers embed, caption, contextualize and topic-tag with the same clients. Both
record under the same metric name — Ray adds a ``ray_`` prefix on export, which
the scrape config renames away — so one PromQL query covers the whole system.

**Exactly one backend per process, chosen once.** Recording to both would
double-count every call: the API process initialises Ray, so ``ray.util.metrics``
there is live rather than a no-op, and the same event would appear on ``/metrics``
*and* on the node's Ray metrics agent. The rule is "record where this process can
actually be scraped":

* Inside a Ray actor — an indexing worker, or the API itself when
  ``ENABLE_RAY_SERVE=true`` makes it a Serve replica — use ``ray.util.metrics``.
  Serve replicas are not individually addressable over HTTP, so a
  ``prometheus_client`` counter in one replica is invisible to a scrape the
  Serve proxy routes to another.
* Otherwise (the plain uvicorn API of the standalone compose deployment) use
  ``prometheus_client``, served by ``/metrics``.

The check mirrors ``services/workers/task_state._task_state_storage_available``,
which already uses actor identity for the same kind of decision.

*Deployment consequence for S3-3 / S3-6 / S3-7:* under Ray Serve these series
appear on the Ray metrics target, not on ``/metrics``. A deployment that scrapes
only ``/metrics`` sees HTTP metrics and no inference metrics; both targets must
be scraped for the set to be complete.

**On the ``provider`` label.** It is the admin-configured endpoint *name*,
stamped onto each client by ``di/factories.make_component_factory`` — bounded by
configuration. Deliberately neither the model nor the base URL: both are
client-controllable through ``metadata.llm_override``, which would make the
label unbounded from the *value* side, the one cardinality failure
``FORBIDDEN_LABELS`` cannot catch.

A request that overrides the endpoint is attributed to the fixed bucket
``client_override``, so a third-party endpoint's failures cannot corrupt the
error rate ``OpenRagInferenceProviderDown`` alerts on. ``_circuit_breaker``
already draws that line with ``skip_if=_targets_client_endpoint``.
