"""Worker-side metric instances, instantiated from the shared specs.

The counterpart to :mod:`core.observability.monitoring`. That module serves the
API process through ``prometheus_client`` and ``/metrics``; this one serves
everything produced inside a Ray actor, where a ``prometheus_client`` counter
would be incremented into a registry nothing ever scrapes.

Both instantiate from :mod:`core.observability.metric_specs`, so the two
backends cannot drift in name, label set or bucket layout.

**How these reach Prometheus.** Ray's per-node metrics agent collects from every
local actor and exposes them on the node's ``MetricsExportPort``
(``--metrics-export-port=8090``, see ``infra/charts/openrag-stack/templates/raycluster.yaml``),
scraped by the chart's ``PodMonitor``. Ray prefixes every name with ``ray_``, and
that ``PodMonitor`` strips it again: a spec named
``openrag_ingest_documents_total`` is exported as
``ray_openrag_ingest_documents_total`` and queried under its spec name, like the
API's own series.

**Querying them.** Ray attaches ``WorkerId``, ``SessionName``, ``NodeAddress``,
``Component`` and ``Version``. Always aggregate those away and always rate
before summing::

    sum without(WorkerId, SessionName, NodeAddress, Component, Version) (
        rate(openrag_ingest_documents_total[5m])
    )

Per-worker counters reset when an actor dies, and ``rate()`` only detects a
reset within a single series — ``rate(sum(...))`` silently loses those resets.
Never drop ``WorkerId`` at scrape time: it is what keeps concurrent workers'
series distinct, and collapsing them puts duplicate samples in one scrape, which
Prometheus rejects wholesale.

**Recording is best-effort, always.** Every function here swallows its own
errors. An indexing task must never fail because a metric could not be written —
and ``observe_stage_duration`` is called from a ``finally`` block, where a raise
would mask the pipeline's real exception. Failures are warned once per metric,
so a broken one is visible without flooding a log that these run against on
every document.

**A caveat on silence.** ``ray.util.metrics`` records happily when Ray is not
initialised — it is a no-op, not an error. That keeps imports safe in unit tests
and in the API process, but it also means "no series in Prometheus" and "this
code never ran under Ray" look identical from the outside. The unit tests
therefore assert that each call site is reached, which is the only failure mode
that can be caught without a live Ray cluster.
