"""Declarative specifications for every OpenRag metric — one source of truth.

**Why specs rather than metric objects.** S3-2's metrics are produced on two
sides of a process boundary. The HTTP and chat-path metrics live in the API
process and use ``prometheus_client``; the per-document ``ingest_*`` metrics
are produced inside a Ray actor (``services/workers/indexer_actor.py``, driven
by ``indexer_pool.py``) and must use ``ray.util.metrics``, because a
``prometheus_client`` counter incremented in a Ray worker is invisible to
``/metrics`` in the API process — there is no shared registry, and under
``ENABLE_RAY_SERVE=true`` (``values-linagora.yaml``) even the API runs as Serve
replicas that HTTP cannot address individually. The exception is
``openrag_ingest_tasks``: a gauge the API process samples from the task state
at scrape time, so it is served on the API's ``/metrics`` like the HTTP metrics.

``openrag_circuit_breaker_state`` (``services/inference/_circuit_breaker.py``)
was the existing instance of that bug: a ``prometheus_client`` Gauge set from
inside workers, so the ``embedder`` and ``vlm`` breakers never reached a scrape.
It now records through the same dual backend. Declaring both backends from one
spec set is what stops the next metric repeating it.

**Why the labels are the important part.** A metric declared with an unbounded
label is not a monitoring bug, it is an availability bug — for the *platform's*
Prometheus, not just ours. ``partition`` is created on write by callers, so it
is bounded by user behaviour rather than by anything we control:
``openrag_ingest_stage_duration_seconds{partition,stage}`` is ~10 500 series at
150 partitions and ~700 000 at 10 000. :data:`FORBIDDEN_LABELS` makes that a
build-time failure (see ``tests/unit/core/observability/test_metric_cardinality.py``)
rather than something discovered when a shared Prometheus runs out of memory.

Questions that genuinely need a tenant breakdown are answered elsewhere by
design: "which partition is failing?" from structured logs (S3-11 binds
``partition`` as a field), "how much has this tenant consumed?" from Postgres
(D2 usage accounting).

**Cardinality of the worker-side set.** Ray injects its own labels —
``WorkerId``, ``SessionName``, ``NodeAddress``, ``Component``, ``Version`` — and
``WorkerId`` changes with every actor process, so each restart mints a fresh
series set. That churn is bounded, not unbounded: Ray's metrics agent drops a
dead worker's series after ``RAY_WORKER_TIMEOUT_S`` (default 120 s, see
``ray/_private/metrics_agent.py``), measured at ~130 s end to end. The worst
case is therefore *restart rate × timeout window*, which at 10 indexer actors is
~2 400 series steady-state and a few hundred more per crash-looping actor.

Two consequences for anyone querying these (S3-4 alert rules, S3-5 dashboards):

* Aggregate with ``sum without(WorkerId, SessionName, NodeAddress, Component,
  Version) (...)``. Recording rules are the right place to write that once.
* Always ``sum(rate(x[5m]))``, never ``rate(sum(x))`` — per-worker counters
  reset when an actor dies, and ``rate()`` only detects a reset within a series.
* Never drop ``WorkerId`` via ``metric_relabel_configs``. It is what keeps
  concurrent workers' series distinct; collapsing them makes one scrape contain
  duplicate samples, which Prometheus rejects wholesale. The saving is not worth
  losing the entire scrape.
