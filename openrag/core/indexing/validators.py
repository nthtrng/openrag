#:
#: * ``txt``/``md``/``html``/``htm``/``eml``/``svg`` are text formats with no
#:   signature to check.
#: * ``wma`` was verified empirically against the bundled matchers and is not
#:   reliably detected, so enforcing it would reject legitimate uploads.
#: * ``doc`` is **not** here either: its parser accepts several formats, so it
#:   is checked against :data:`_TOLERANT_SIGNATURES` instead.
#: * Audio and video containers other than those above are left out until the
#:   accepted brand variants can be checked against real samples; guessing at
#:   them risks refusing valid media.
#: * ``docx``/``pptx`` are **not** here: a ZIP's authoritative index is its
#:   central directory, which sits at the end of the file, so no head buffer can
#:   settle them. They are checked by :func:`validate_ooxml_package` instead.

#: Extensions whose parser legitimately consumes several formats, so the check
#: refuses what ``filetype`` recognises as *something else* rather than
#: requiring a signature of its own. The value is what stays acceptable beyond
#: "no signature at all".
#:
#: ``doc`` is the only one, and it is the exception to the allowlist above for a
#: reason that is a property of the format, not a shortcut. Spire.Doc loads
#: OLE2, RTF, HTML and plain text under a ``.doc`` name — all four were verified
#: loading — and Word has historically written all of them that way. OLE2 and
#: HTML/text are indistinguishable to ``filetype`` (it reports ``None`` for
#: each), so requiring a known-good signature would refuse legitimate uploads.
#: That is exactly why ``.doc`` was excluded from #957 and became the only
#: accepted format with no check at all (#964).
#:
#: What this does close: a renamed PDF, ZIP/OOXML, image, archive or executable
#: reaching Spire. Those are the parser-bomb vectors, and ``filetype`` names
#: every one of them.
#:
#: What it deliberately does not: arbitrary *unsignatured* bytes still reach
#: Spire, where they fail the load and fall back to ``GetText()`` — the path
#: ``DocParser`` already has. Nor does it stop a crafted ``.doc``, which carries
#: a real document's signature; bounding that is #997's job. Narrowing this to
#: an allowlist (OLE2 + RTF only) is possible once someone confirms no legacy
#: HTML/text ``.doc`` files exist in the corpora — a corpus question, not a code
#: one.
