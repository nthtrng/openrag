"""Transitional port for the indexing dispatch operations.

``IndexingService`` (Phase 8D.1) owns the business logic around file
ingestion — format/quota/existence checks, metadata assembly, workspace
validation — but the heavy lifting (serialize → chunk → embed → insert)
still runs inside the ``Indexer`` Ray actor, and task bookkeeping lives
in the ``TaskStateManager`` Ray actor. Phase 9 removes that Ray
indirection.

Defining the operations the service needs on a dedicated port keeps
``IndexingService`` Ray-free (8H: no Ray import / remote call under
``services/orchestrators/``). A small shim in ``services/storage/``
adapts the two Ray actors to this interface during the shim period;
Phase 9 swaps it for a direct pipeline call and deletes the shim.

No Ray / pymilvus / LangChain types leak across this boundary — only
plain dicts and strings.
