"""``@with_inference_metrics`` — the decorator that instruments an endpoint call.

Sits alongside ``_circuit_breaker`` and ``_retry`` in the same decorator stack,
and its **position in that stack is part of the contract**::

    @with_inference_metrics("chat")      # outermost
    @with_circuit_breaker("llm", ...)
    @with_retry(max_attempts=3)
    async def chat(self, ...): ...

Outermost, for two reasons.

*One observation per logical call.* Inside ``@with_retry`` every transport
attempt would be counted, so an endpoint that is flaky but recovering would
present in the error ratio identically to one that is down. The question the
metric answers is "did this call succeed", not "how many packets did it take".
The duration recorded is likewise the whole call, retries included, which is
what a caller actually waited.

*``circuit_open`` is visible.* ``CircuitBreakerError`` is raised *by*
``with_circuit_breaker``, so anything underneath it never sees the open-circuit
case — and "we stopped even trying" is a materially different condition from "it
returned an error", both for the dashboard and for the S3-4 alert.

    Both checks are on *families*, deliberately.

    ``CircuitBreakerOpenError`` rather than aiobreaker's ``CircuitBreakerError``:
    ``with_circuit_breaker`` sits inside this decorator and converts the latter,
    so matching on it recorded every open circuit as a plain ``error``.

    Embedding clients raise ``EmbeddingTimeoutError``, which descends from
    ``EmbeddingError`` and not from ``InferenceTimeoutError`` — so a vLLM
    embedding timeout landed in the generic bucket and left the timeout ratio
    reading low exactly where embedding capacity was the problem.

    Cancellation is the caller giving up, not the provider failing: a client
    stopping a stream, a caller's ``asyncio.wait_for`` deadline, or the sibling
    batches cancelled after one failed. Counting it as ``error`` let one real
    failure — or users pressing stop — raise a healthy provider's error ratio.

    A 4xx is the provider refusing *this request* — an unknown model named in
    ``metadata.llm_override``, a prompt over the context length — so any user
    could otherwise drive a healthy provider's error ratio up at will. Throttling
    (429) and a provider-side request timeout (408) are the provider struggling,
    and stay ``error``. The circuit breaker draws the same line (``_is_excluded``).
