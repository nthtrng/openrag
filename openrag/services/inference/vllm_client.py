"""vLLM / OpenAI-compatible inference clients.

Three classes grouped by server — all talk to the same OpenAI-compatible API:

* ``VLLMClient``   → ``LLM``      (chat completions)
* ``VLLMEmbedder`` → ``Embedder``  (embeddings)
* ``VLLMVision``   → ``VLM``       (image captioning via chat completions)

Each class has its own circuit breaker instance so an embedder outage
