        Every setter here is re-entrant by design: a retried actor call can
        set FAILED on an already-failed task, and ``finish_rejected_submission``
        can run after ``set_failed_if_not_cancelled`` for the same task.
        Counting the *write* rather than the transition would inflate the
        failure ratio that ``OpenRagIngestFailureRate`` (S3-4) alerts on, so
        the guard is on the previous state, not on the new one.

        The first terminal state wins. A task later moved from FAILED to
        COMPLETED counts once, as failed — the guard cannot distinguish a
        correction from a duplicate write, and under-counting a rare correction
        is safer than double-counting every retry.

        Counted in the TaskStateManager rather than in the indexer worker
        because the worker only sees documents that reached it. Tasks that
        fail before dispatch — a rejected submission, a stale ref-less task,
        a cancellation while queued — are exactly the systemic failures the
        alert needs to see, and the worker never observes them.
