        vLLM sends ``truncate_prompt_tokens = max_model_len - 1``, so anything
        past that is dropped *before* it is embedded — no error, no log, just a
        vector that describes part of the chunk while the store keeps all of it.
        Retrieval then misses text the chunk visibly contains.

        The chunker deliberately does not prevent every case: an indivisible
        unit (a table row larger than the window) is kept whole rather than cut
        into fragments that are no longer valid rows. This makes that trade
        visible instead of silent.

        ``chunk.token_count`` is a *lower bound* on what actually gets embedded:
        contextualization rewrites ``text`` with the ``[CONTEXT]`` envelope via
        ``model_copy`` without refreshing the count, and the envelope only adds.
        So the stored count settles almost every chunk on its own — over the
        limit is already conclusive, and far enough under it cannot be pushed
        over by an envelope. Only the band in between is re-tokenised.

        That matters because this runs synchronously on the actor's event loop,
        unconditionally, for every file — including partitions on
        ``recursive_splitter`` that use nothing else here. Re-tokenising every
        chunk cost ~360 ms per 3000-chunk document (more than double that with
        the production ``ChatOpenAI`` counter), freezing every other in-flight
        file's continuation. The adjacent chunk stage goes out of its way to
        avoid exactly this, running the chunker under ``asyncio.to_thread``.

    downstream reads it. Chunking works from ``text_blocks``, and the caption has
    already been substituted into those via ``metadata["markdown_ref"]``; no
    post-caption stage touches ``.images`` at all.

    ``ImageBlock.image_url`` would also encode these bytes, but it has no callers

    are never read by anyone — holding them then is pure waste. Reached whether

    enrichment failure, and a failed caption makes the bytes no more useful than
    a successful one.
