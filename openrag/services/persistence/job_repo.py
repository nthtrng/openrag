"""asyncpg-backed :class:`JobRepository`.

The durable record of indexing job state. The actor bounds its own retention,
so it stops being able to answer for a task once it evicts it, and a restart
takes the rest with it. These rows are what survives both, and the queue views
union them with whatever the actor still holds: history comes from here, live
sub-state from the actor that is writing it.

Writes stay best-effort by design: a Postgres blip degrades history, it does
not fail indexing.
