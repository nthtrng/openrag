"""Postgres implementation of :class:`WorkspaceRepository`.

Backs the ``workspaces`` table and the ``workspace_files`` many-to-many
join. The legacy
:class:`components.indexer.vectordb.utils.PartitionFileManager` exposed
ten workspace methods that all map onto this class:
``create_workspace``, ``list_workspaces``, ``get_workspace``,
``delete_workspace``, ``add_files_to_workspace``,
``remove_file_from_workspace``, ``list_workspace_files``,
``get_file_workspaces``, ``get_existing_file_ids``,
``remove_file_from_all_workspaces``.

The join references the canonical ``files.id`` and ``workspaces.id``
integer PKs (not the client-facing ``file_id`` / ``workspace_id`` strings,
neither of which is unique across partitions), so deletion cascades
correctly — when a ``files`` or ``workspaces`` row goes away the
workspace_files entries it backed go with it without any application-side
bookkeeping. Conversely the workspace APIs accept and emit the human
string ids; the repo translates at the boundary, and because
``workspace_id`` is only unique per partition every translation is keyed
on ``(partition, workspace_id)``.
