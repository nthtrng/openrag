# Grafana service dashboard

The **OpenRAG Service** dashboard (UID `openrag-service`) answers one question per row: is
OpenRAG indexing, answering and serving what it should? The
[HTTP dashboard](/openrag/documentation/grafana_http_dashboard/) says whether requests
succeed. This one covers what happens behind them: the indexing pipeline, the inference
endpoints, and retrieval's catalog drift.

It ships with the other dashboards in `infra/charts/openrag-stack/dashboards/`. The Compose
monitoring overlay provisions it into the **OpenRAG** folder, and the Helm chart delivers it
as a sidecar ConfigMap (see [Kubernetes monitoring](/openrag/documentation/kubernetes/#monitoring)).

## What it needs scraped

OpenRAG exports metrics from two places, and a panel stays empty when its target is not
scraped:

| Target | Carries |
| --- | --- |
| The API's `GET /metrics` | queue depth, chat and rerank calls, circuit breakers, model endpoint readiness, catalog drift |
| Ray's metrics agent | document outcomes, stage durations, queue wait, the parse watchdog, embed and VLM calls |

How each deployment collects them:

| Deployment | API `/metrics` | Ray's metrics agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compose, monitoring overlay | job `openrag` | job `ray`, on the port the overlay pins with `RAY_METRICS_EXPORT_PORT` |
| Kubernetes, `ray.enabled=true` | `openrag.metrics.serviceMonitor` | a PodMonitor on the Ray pods' `metrics` port |
| Kubernetes, `ray.enabled=false` | `openrag.metrics.serviceMonitor` | not collected (see Limitations) |

Ray prefixes everything it exports with `ray_`. Both scrape paths above strip it from
OpenRAG's series, so they are stored under the names the API exports and the alert rules
query. Panels still select `{__name__=~"(ray_)?openrag_…"}`, so a Prometheus that scrapes
Ray without that rename fills them too. Either way, a metric exported from both targets,
such as `openrag_inference_requests_total`, is summed across the two.

See the [metrics reference](/openrag/documentation/metrics_reference/) for every series,
its labels, and the target that exports it.

## Rows

### At a glance

Seven tiles, each mirroring an alert:

| Tile | Turns red when | Alert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API scrape | Prometheus cannot scrape `/metrics` | `OpenRagTargetDown` |
| Queued tasks | yellow at 50 queued | `OpenRagBacklogGrowing` |
| Since last parse | neutral: only a problem while tasks are queued | `OpenRagIngestStalled` |
| Failed documents · 15m | 25% of finished documents failed | `OpenRagIngestFailureRate` |
| Inference errors · 10m | the worst endpoint fails half its calls | `OpenRagInferenceProviderDown` |
| Open breakers | any circuit breaker is open | `OpenRagCircuitBreakerOpen` |
| Catalog drift · 1h | any retrieval hit dropped for a missing file | `OpenRagCatalogDriftDetected` |

The colours use the alerts' default thresholds. If you tune an alert, the tile does not
follow it.

An empty tile is not a healthy one. **Unknown** on *Queued tasks* means the API could not
read the task state manager; an idle queue shows `0`.

### Ingestion throughput

Documents reaching a terminal state per minute, stacked by outcome; the failure ratio over
the 5-minute window the failure-rate alert reads; and totals over the selected range.
Cancelled uploads are counted but never treated as failures.

### Backlog

Tasks queued and in progress, queue wait (admission to the start of processing, p50 and
p95), and the time since each parser pool last finished a document. A pool nobody uploads
to (audio, say) climbs forever; that is expected. *Clock-skew events* counts queue-wait
measurements that came out negative because the API and worker clocks disagree. When it is
non-zero, the queue-wait panel reads low.

### Pipeline stages

The p95 duration of each stage, on a logarithmic axis because chunking takes milliseconds and
a large PDF parse takes minutes. Next to it, the average number of documents in each stage:
seconds of stage work per second of wall clock. The tallest band is where indexing time
goes.

### Inference

Calls by operation, the error ratio per registry endpoint, and failed calls by outcome. Below
them: p95 latency per endpoint and operation, circuit-breaker state, token throughput, and
the readiness probe of every model endpoint in use. `client_override` groups requests that
named their own endpoint through `metadata.llm_override`, so their failures never count
against an endpoint you run.

### Retrieval

Catalog drift over the trailing hour: retrieval hits dropped because their file is gone from
the catalog. A hit is dropped per query, so this is not a document count. Only non-zero
matters; see [catalog reconciliation](/openrag/documentation/catalog_reconciliation/).

## Aggregation choices

- **No per-partition, per-user or per-file breakdown.** No OpenRAG metric carries those
  labels, and a unit test fails the build if a dashboard query references one. Which partition
  is failing is a log question, answered by the `partition` field of the structured logs.
- **Queue depth takes `max`, not `sum`.** Every API replica attached to one Ray cluster reads
  the same task state manager, so summing would multiply the queue by the replica count. The
  same applies to model endpoint readiness (`min`).
- **Rates come before sums.** Each Ray worker is its own series and restarts reset it; summing
  first would read every restart as a drop.

## Limitations

- **Embedded Ray on Kubernetes is not collected.** With `ray.enabled=false` (the chart
  default) Ray runs inside the API pod on a random metrics port, and the chart scrapes nothing
  there. The ingestion rows and the embed and VLM half of the inference row stay empty.
- **Everything Prometheus scrapes is aggregated.** Two OpenRAG releases scraped by one
  Prometheus show as one.
- **Ray Serve.** Under `ENABLE_RAY_SERVE=true` the chart does not scrape the API's `/metrics`
  (see [Prometheus metrics](/openrag/documentation/prometheus_metrics/#limitations)), so every
  panel it feeds stays empty: API scrape, queue depth, readiness and catalog drift.
