title: Deploying OpenRAG on Kubernetes
---

This guide explains how to deploy the **OpenRAG** stack on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **Kubernetes cluster** with **GPU nodes** available (NVIDIA runtime) and nvidia-gpu-operator installed.
- A **StorageClass** that supports **ReadWriteMany** (`RWX`) access mode.  
  This is required because the Ray cluster workers and the OpenRAG app need to access the same shared volumes (e.g. for `.venv`, model weights, logs, data).
- If using ingress, the ingress-nginx controller needs to be installed on the cluster.

---

## Steps

1. **Create a `values.yaml` file**:

   - Copy or create a new `values.yaml` at the root of your repo.
   - You can see the full example file inside the chart:
     [values.yaml](https://github.com/linagora/openrag/blob/dev/infra/charts/openrag-stack/values.yaml)
   - Customize the values you need (e.g., image tags, resources, ingress host, storage class, environment variables, secrets).

2. **Set environment and secrets**:

   - Edit the `env.config` and `env.secrets` sections in your `values.yaml`.
   - Secrets (API keys, tokens, Hugging Face credentials, etc.) will be mounted into the cluster as Kubernetes secrets.
   - For managed PostgreSQL, point the `POSTGRES_*` values at the external database and disable database auto-creation.

3. **Install or upgrade the release from GHCR**:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade\
      --install openrag oci://ghcr.io/linagora/openrag-stack\
      -f ./values.yaml\
      --version 0.6.0
   ```

   - `openrag` is the Helm release name.
   - `oci://ghcr.io/linagora/openrag-stack` is the remote chart location.
   - `-f ./values.yaml` specifies your custom configuration.
   - `--version 0.6.0` ensures you deploy a specific chart version — check `Chart.yaml` for the current version before installing.

---

## Upgrading to chart 0.6.0

Chart 0.6.0 renames the PVCs, ConfigMap and Secret from fixed `rag-*` names to
`{{ fullname }}-*`, so they follow the release instead of colliding between two
installs in one namespace. With the default `fullnameOverride: "openrag"`:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `rag-model-weights`, `rag-data`, `rag-logs`, `rag-venv` | `openrag-model-weights`, `openrag-data`, `openrag-logs`, `openrag-venv` |
| `rag-env` | `openrag-env` |
| `rag-env-secrets` | `openrag-env-secrets` |

The old PVCs carry `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so **the upgrade does not
delete them — but it does not mount them either**. It provisions new, empty ones
under the new names, and the release comes up as if it had no indexed data. Pick
one before upgrading:

- **Keep the existing volumes.** Set `fullnameOverride: "rag"`, which reproduces
  the old names exactly. Also set `postgresql.fullnameOverride`,
  `milvus.fullnameOverride` and `vllm.hfTokenSecretName` to match (they are kept
  in sync by hand — `values.yaml` explains why, and `NOTES.txt` warns on an
  HF_TOKEN secret-name mismatch).
- **Migrate to the new names.** Copy the data across (e.g. a Job mounting both
  PVCs), then delete the old ones once the release is healthy.

## Notes

For the default direct-API deployment, startup and liveness probes use
`/health_check`, while the readiness probe uses `/ready`. When
`ENABLE_RAY_SERVE=true`, the chart automatically uses exec probes against the
Ray head because the Ray Serve HTTP proxy does not run on the API pod. Ray
Serve requires `ray.enabled=true`; Helm rejects that invalid combination.
Readiness returns 503 when startup is incomplete or PostgreSQL, Milvus, or Ray is
unavailable. Model checks are reported in the response but do not gate the whole
API, so optional VLM/STT and partition-specific model endpoints do not remove
healthy replicas from service. Checks use short timeouts and results are cached
for two seconds. Model probes check availability without running inference; they
do not guarantee every request will succeed. Use an application image that
includes `/ready` with these probes.

Readiness uses the configured model endpoints and API keys, just like inference.
HTTP endpoints do not encrypt those credentials; configure HTTPS when transport
encryption is required.

Prometheus exposes aggregate endpoint state through
`openrag_model_endpoint_ready{provider,kind}` and discovery health through
`openrag_model_endpoint_discovery_up`. These labels are intentionally bounded,
and the public readiness endpoint reports aggregate configuration-reference
counts without exposing partition or preset names.

- If using a public IP instead of a hostname, you can leave `ingress.host` empty in your `values.yaml`.  
  The ingress will then match all hosts.

- If you later configure a hostname + TLS (via cert-manager), just update `ingress.host` and redeploy.

- Ensure your GPU nodes have the correct NVIDIA drivers and `nvidia` `RuntimeClass` configured.

## Managed PostgreSQL

The chart can run against a database that is provisioned outside OpenRAG, which is the recommended setup on OpenShift or cloud-managed PostgreSQL.

Pre-create the database before installing the release. If `POSTGRES_DATABASE` is not set, OpenRAG uses `partitions_for_collection_<VDB_COLLECTION_NAME>`. The app role does not need `CREATEDB` or superuser rights; it needs to connect to that database and own, or be allowed to create objects in, the target schema.

In `values.yaml`, disable the bundled PostgreSQL chart, set `postgresProvisioning.autoCreateDatabase` to `false`, set `postgresProvisioning.runMigrationsInApp` to `false`, and enable `postgresProvisioning.migrationJob`. Then provide the managed database connection through `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and optionally `POSTGRES_DATABASE`.

The migration Job (`templates/postgres-migration-job.yaml`) is a Helm hook, annotated with `helm.sh/hook: pre-install,pre-upgrade`. You never invoke it directly: Helm runs it automatically as part of each `helm install` and `helm upgrade`, before it creates or updates the OpenRAG Deployment, and waits for it to finish. It applies the Alembic migrations against the pre-created database (it migrates the schema but does not create the database). The OpenRAG API then starts against an already-migrated schema.

When `postgresProvisioning.migrationJob` is disabled (the default), the Job is not rendered at all and the application runs migrations itself at startup instead.

## GPU metrics

The chart deploys no GPU exporter. GPU metrics come from the DCGM exporter that
the NVIDIA GPU Operator — a prerequisite above — runs on every GPU node
(`dcgmExporter.enabled`, on by default). What is left is getting Prometheus to
scrape it and Grafana to show it.

1. **Scrape the exporter.** With the Prometheus Operator (e.g.
   kube-prometheus-stack), have the GPU Operator create its ServiceMonitor. That
   is the default from GPU Operator v26.7.0; earlier releases ship it disabled:

   ```bash
   # Pin the version you already run: --reuse-values without --version also
   # upgrades the GPU Operator to the latest chart.
   helm upgrade gpu-operator nvidia/gpu-operator -n gpu-operator \
     --version <installed version> --reuse-values \
     --set dcgmExporter.serviceMonitor.enabled=true \
     --set dcgmExporter.serviceMonitor.additionalLabels.release=kube-prometheus-stack
   ```

   The `release` label must be whatever your Prometheus `serviceMonitorSelector`
   matches (kube-prometheus-stack selects its own release name). An unmatched
   ServiceMonitor is created but never scraped. Without the Prometheus Operator,
   the exporter's `nvidia-dcgm-exporter` Service (port 9400) carries the
   `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` annotation for annotation-based discovery.

2. **Check it arrived.** `DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL` should return series in
   Prometheus. Expect one series per GPU — or, when the exporter runs with
   `KUBERNETES_VIRTUAL_GPUS=true` for time-sliced or MPS-shared GPUs, one per pod
   using each GPU. The dashboard counts each GPU once either way.

3. **Import the dashboard.** The GPU panels of the Infrastructure Overview
   dashboard (`infra/compose/grafana/dashboards/system-overview.json`) read the
   DCGM exporter here and `nvidia_gpu_exporter` under Docker Compose — whichever
   is scraped — so the same file serves both. Its panels use the datasource uid
   `prometheus`, which is kube-prometheus-stack's default; with another uid,
   change it in the JSON before importing.

The GPU panels aggregate every GPU that Prometheus scrapes, not only the nodes
running OpenRAG, and the host panels likewise need node-exporter
(kube-prometheus-stack ships it) and aggregate every node.
