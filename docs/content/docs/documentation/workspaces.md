title: Workspaces
description: Group files into workspaces for scoped search and chat
---

Workspaces let you organize files within a partition into named subsets. When searching or chatting, you can target a specific workspace so that only its files are considered — without affecting the underlying partition structure.

---

## Concepts

- A **workspace** belongs to exactly one partition, and its `workspace_id` is unique **within that partition** only: two partitions may each have a workspace called `default`. A workspace is always addressed as `(partition, workspace_id)`.
- A file can belong to **multiple workspaces** (or none)
- Workspaces do not duplicate files — they reference existing partition files
- Deleting a workspace deletes **orphaned files** (files not in any other workspace) from the partition automatically
- Deleting a file removes it from all workspaces it belongs to

---

## Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    partitions ||--o{ workspaces : contains
    workspaces ||--o{ workspace_files : has
    files ||--o{ workspace_files : referenced_by

    workspaces {
        int id PK
        varchar workspace_id
        varchar partition_name FK
        varchar display_name
        int created_by FK
        datetime created_at
    }

    workspace_files {
        int id PK
        int workspace_id FK
        int file_id FK
    }
```

**Constraints:**
- `UniqueConstraint(partition_name, workspace_id)` — workspace IDs are unique per partition, not globally
- `workspace_files.workspace_id` references the integer `workspaces.id`, not the client-facing string (which is not unique across partitions)
- `UniqueConstraint(workspace_id, file_id)` on `workspace_files` — a file appears at most once per workspace
- Cascade delete: dropping a workspace removes its `workspace_files` rows

## API Endpoints

All workspace endpoints live under `/partition/{partition}/workspaces`.

### Workspace CRUD

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces` | Editor | Create a workspace |
| GET | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces` | Viewer | List all workspaces in partition |
| GET | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces/{workspace_id}` | Viewer | Get workspace details |
| DELETE | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces/{workspace_id}` | Owner | Delete workspace (and orphaned files, unless `keep_files=true`) |

### Workspace File Management

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces/{workspace_id}/files` | Editor | Add files to workspace |
| GET | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces/{workspace_id}/files` | Viewer | List files in workspace |
| DELETE | `/partition/{partition}/workspaces/{workspace_id}/files/{file_id}` | Editor | Remove file from workspace |

---

### Create a Workspace

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/partition/my-partition/workspaces" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workspace_id": "project-alpha", "display_name": "Project Alpha"}'
```

```json
{"status": "created", "workspace_id": "project-alpha"}
```

### List Workspaces

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/partition/my-partition/workspaces" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "workspace_id": "project-alpha",
      "partition_name": "my-partition",
      "display_name": "Project Alpha",
      "created_by": 1,
      "created_at": "2026-03-06T10:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add Files to a Workspace

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/partition/my-partition/workspaces/project-alpha/files" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_ids": ["report.pdf", "notes.md"]}'
```

```json
{"status": "added", "file_ids": ["report.pdf", "notes.md"]}
```

### Delete a Workspace

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/partition/my-partition/workspaces/project-alpha" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```json
{"status": "deleted", "orphaned_files_deleted": 1, "orphaned_files_failed": [], "kept_files": 0}
```

Only files uploaded with workspace assignment are automatically removed, and only after their last workspace is deleted. Independently indexed files remain in the partition even when attached to the deleted workspace. Files indexed before ownership tracking was introduced are also preserved because their origin is unknown.

#### Keeping Orphaned Files (`keep_files=true`)

Pass `?keep_files=true` to delete the workspace and its membership rows **without** touching any files, even ones that would otherwise be orphaned:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/partition/my-partition/workspaces/project-alpha?keep_files=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```json
{"status": "deleted", "orphaned_files_deleted": 0, "orphaned_files_failed": [], "kept_files": 1}
```

- `kept_files` reports how many files would have been orphaned and were left indexed in the partition instead of being deleted.
- The workspace and its `workspace_files` rows are still removed as usual — only the file-deletion step is skipped.
- With `keep_files=false` (the default), only exclusively workspace-owned orphans are deleted.
- Retained files become independent partition files, so attaching them to another workspace does not make them eligible for automatic deletion again.
- Useful when files may be shared outside of the workspace model (e.g. referenced by an external system) and must never be deleted as a side effect of removing a workspace.

---

## Upload with Workspace Assignment

Files can be added to one or more workspaces at upload time using the `workspace_ids` form parameter:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/indexer/partition/my-partition/file/my-file-id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F 'metadata={"mimetype": "application/pdf"}' \
  -F 'workspace_ids=["project-alpha", "project-beta"]'
```

The `workspace_ids` field accepts a JSON array of workspace IDs. Each workspace must exist in the target partition, otherwise the request is rejected with a 404. A file uploaded without `workspace_ids` and attached later through the workspace-files endpoint remains an independently indexed partition file; deleting that workspace does not remove it. Use upload-time assignment when the file should be owned and purged with its last workspace.

Uploads remain protected while their workspace attachments are being completed. If attachment fails, indexing is interrupted before ownership transfer, or a requested workspace is deleted during attachment, the file remains independently indexed to avoid losing uploaded content.

---

## Workspace-Scoped Search

Pass the `workspace` query parameter to restrict search results to files in that workspace:

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/search/partition/my-partition?text=quarterly+results&workspace=project-alpha" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Only chunks from files belonging to the `project-alpha` workspace are returned.

### Multi-Partition Search

The `workspace` parameter also works with multi-partition search. The workspace is looked up among the partitions being searched only; if more than one of them owns a workspace with that id, the request is rejected with `422 [WORKSPACE_AMBIGUOUS]` and must target a single partition (`partitions=<one>` or `/search/partition/{partition}`).

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/search?partitions=my-partition&text=quarterly+results&workspace=project-alpha" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

## Workspace-Scoped Chat

To scope a chat completion to a workspace, include the `workspace` field in the request metadata:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openrag-my-partition",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the Q1 results"}],
    "metadata": {"workspace": "project-alpha"}
  }'
```

The RAG pipeline resolves the workspace to its file list and filters the vector search accordingly.

## Deletion Behavior

### Deleting a Workspace

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Delete workspace] --> B[Find workspace files]
    B --> C{File in other workspaces?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Keep file]
    C -->|No| H{Independently indexed?}
    H -->|Yes| D
    H -->|No| G{keep_files=true?}
    G -->|Yes| D
    G -->|No| E[Delete orphaned file from partition]
    D --> F[Done]
    E --> F
```

### Deleting a File

When a file is deleted from a partition (via `DELETE /partition/{partition}/file/{file_id}`), it is automatically removed from all workspaces that reference it.

### Deleting a Partition

When a partition is deleted, all its workspaces and workspace-file associations are cascade-deleted along with the files.
