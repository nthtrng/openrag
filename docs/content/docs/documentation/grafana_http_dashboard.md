# Grafana HTTP dashboard

The OpenRAG HTTP dashboard starts with a service-level health summary and progressively exposes more detail. Operators can see whether the service needs attention without understanding Prometheus, while developers can filter traffic by endpoint and HTTP method when investigating a problem.

## Before opening the dashboard

Start OpenRAG with its monitoring overlay from `infra/compose`:

```bash
export SHARED_ENV="$PWD/.env"
docker compose --env-file .env \
  -f docker-compose.yaml \
  -f monitoring.docker-compose.yaml \
  up -d
```

Grafana must be reachable from the browser. For a remote deployment, `GRAFANA_URL` and `GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL` must use the public hostname rather than `localhost`. `localhost` is appropriate only when the browser runs on the server or reaches it through an SSH tunnel.

Confirm that Prometheus and Grafana are running:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yaml \
  -f monitoring.docker-compose.yaml \
  ps prometheus grafana
```

Open Grafana through the URL configured in `GRAFANA_URL` and sign in with `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER` and `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## Check the Prometheus data source

Open **Connections → Data sources → Prometheus**. The bundled data source uses `http://prometheus:9090` and is Grafana's default. The dashboard does not depend on its name or UID: every panel reads the **Data source** selector at the top of the dashboard, which starts on the default Prometheus data source.

The bundled Prometheus scrapes `GET /metrics` on the API with the
`METRICS_TOKEN` from the OpenRAG `.env`: the overlay writes it into the
Prometheus container, so the API and its scraper always agree, and the overlay
refuses to start without it. For an external Prometheus or Grafana, see
[Prometheus metrics](/openrag/documentation/prometheus_metrics/).

Open **Explore**, select Prometheus, and run:

```promql
openrag_http_requests_total
```

A working query returns series with `method`, `endpoint`, and `status_code` labels. If it returns no data, send a few requests to OpenRAG and wait for the next Prometheus scrape.

## How to edit a panel

Open the dashboard, hover over a panel, select its menu, and choose **Edit**. The preview occupies the top of the editor, queries appear at the bottom, and visualization settings appear in the right sidebar.

For a Prometheus query:

1. Select the **Query** tab and the Prometheus data source.
2. Find query **A** and switch from **Builder** to **Code**.
3. Paste the PromQL expression and select **Run queries**.
4. Choose the visualization in the right sidebar.
5. Set the title and description under **Panel options**.
6. Set the unit and decimals under **Standard options**.
7. For a Stat panel, select **Calculate** and **Last not null** under **Value options**.
8. Select **Apply**, then save the dashboard.

If the **Code** button is hidden, widen the window, reduce the browser zoom, or open the query row's menu and select **Switch to code**.

## Dashboard organization

### OpenRAG Health

The first row answers four immediate questions:

- **Requests/sec:** Is OpenRAG receiving traffic?
- **Error rate:** What percentage of requests are failing?
- **P95 latency:** How long do 95% of requests take?
- **Service status:** Can Prometheus reach OpenRAG?

The Error rate and P95 latency cards use green, yellow, and red thresholds. Their thresholds are operational defaults, not universal service-level objectives; deployments should adjust them to match expected workloads.

To configure the Error rate Stat panel, use **Percent (0-100)** as the unit, one decimal place, and **Last not null** as the calculation. Under **Thresholds**, choose **Absolute** mode and configure:

| Starting value | Color | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base | Green | Below 1% |
| 1 | Yellow | Between 1% and 5% |
| 5 | Red | At least 5% |

The query already returns a percentage between 0 and 100, so do not use the `Percent (0.0-1.0)` unit.

### HTTP Trends

The trends row shows traffic grouped by method, separates 4xx client errors from 5xx server errors, and places p50, p95, and p99 latency on one chart. Keeping the percentiles together makes the gap between typical and worst-case behavior visible.

### Problem Endpoints

The problem row ranks the five routes with the highest error percentage and the five routes with the highest p95 latency. These are current rankings, so their queries run as instant queries and use horizontal bar gauges.

### Endpoint Diagnostics

The final row uses the **Endpoint** and **Method** selectors at the top of the dashboard. It shows filtered request rate, status-code traffic, and a latency-distribution heatmap. Select **All** to restore a service-wide view.

## Dashboard variables

Variables are configured under **Dashboard settings → Variables**.

**Data source** (`DS_PROMETHEUS`) selects the Prometheus data source every panel and variable queries. Keep panels bound to `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` rather than to a data source picked from the list: a picked data source is saved by UID, and that UID exists only in the Grafana it was picked in.

**API scrape job** (`job`, hidden) holds the scrape job of the API's `/metrics`, read with `label_values(openrag_model_endpoint_discovery_up, job)`. That gauge is exported from startup, while the HTTP counters have no series until the API serves its first request, so the card works on an idle deployment. It is `openrag` on Compose and the ServiceMonitor's Service name on Kubernetes, and the Service status card reads `up{job=~"$job"}`. It is left on All, which keeps the card on the jobs that query returns — every OpenRAG API this Prometheus scrapes, and nothing else. Unlike **Endpoint** and **Method**, it defines no All value, so All never widens into `.*`.

**Endpoint** and **Method** use Prometheus, allow multiple values, include an **All** option, and use `.*` as the custom All value.

The Endpoint variable reads:

```promql
label_values(openrag_http_requests_total, endpoint)
```

The Method variable reads:

```promql
label_values(openrag_http_requests_total, method)
```

Filtered queries match the selections with regular expressions:

```promql
{endpoint=~"$endpoint", method=~"$method"}
```

## Persist changes in the repository

The bundled dashboard is provisioned from `infra/charts/openrag-stack/dashboards/openrag-http.json`, the one copy that both the Compose overlay and the Helm chart deliver. A change saved only in Grafana can be lost when the container is recreated.

After testing a dashboard copy, open **Dashboard settings → JSON model** or **Share → Export**, export the JSON without the external-sharing option, and replace the provisioned file. Preserve the UID `openrag-http`; the Admin UI link depends on it.

Validate the file before restarting Grafana:

```bash
jq empty ../charts/openrag-stack/dashboards/openrag-http.json
docker restart openrag-grafana
docker logs --tail 50 openrag-grafana
```

After Grafana restarts, refresh the dashboard and confirm that both selectors and all four rows are present.

## Common problems

**The page returns 502 Bad Gateway.** The Admin UI proxy cannot reach the Grafana container. Confirm that Grafana is running and attached to the same Compose network.

**A panel shows No data.** Confirm the selected time range, generate OpenRAG traffic, check the Endpoint and Method selectors, and run the query in Explore.

**Service status shows Unknown.** The card finds the API's scrape job from `openrag_model_endpoint_discovery_up`, so it stays Unknown until Prometheus has scraped the API at least once in the selected time range. Run `openrag_model_endpoint_discovery_up` in Explore: no series means the scrape itself is failing; check `up` and the target's last error in Prometheus.

**Dashboard edits disappear.** Export the tested dashboard and update the provisioned JSON file instead of relying on Grafana's internal database.
